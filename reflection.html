    <h1>Reflections</h1>
    <p>When we created the wireframe for our website, we had one goal in mind, which was to create a simple, yet clean looking website. This led to the idea to arrange our pictures in colons. We wanted the users to be able to scroll down our website, where each picture from this summer would be displayed on the left side, whilst the text describing each picture on the right. In addition, we wanted the photographs to be evenly sized and also slightly larger so that the users could view the photographs in detail. The main challenge we faced was getting the images to align correct  when the user resized their viewport. At the beginning, the images were in different aspect ratios and didn’t adhere to a coherent standard. This problem was solved after some minor fixes.

    <p>When designing a modern web page, it is important to take responsiveness into account. More and more users are using mobile devices, and users are often moving between desktops, tablets and mobile devices. Therefore, it is important to stay consistent across the board and not present drastically new design patterns when a user changes their view port. However, the web page needs to change somewhat to take account of the different display sizes of different devices. Therefore, we made sure to make our web page responsive.

    <p>When we implemented our wireframes, we made sure to think about what CSS style rules would be universal across both of our wireframes. Since our design was quite straight forward, this didn’t pose too much of a problem. After a short brainstorming session, we concluded on what was needed and started to collaborate in our repository.

    <p>When we started to work on the HTML code for our page, we had a short discussion in order to decide whether we should choose the <picture> tag or the <img> tag. We started by summarizing what we had learned during the classes, and weighed the pros and cons of both tags. After some discussions, we concluded that the picture tag would be preferable if the web page included many images and speed was a major concern, since the picture tag enables more fine grained control on which picture file is served to which viewport size. At the end, we chose to use the <img> tag because we concluded that it would make it easier to keep the images current and updated if we ever wanted to make a new version of our page. Furthermore, we thought that speed would be a major concern for the page that we were building.

    When we created the wireframe for our website, we had one goal in mind, which was to create a simple, yet clean and minimalistic looking website. This led to the idea to arrange our pictures in columns. We wanted the users to be able to scroll down our website, where each picture from this summer would be displayed alternating from left to right. In addition, we wanted the photographs to be evenly sized and also slightly larger so that the users could view the photographs in detail. The main challenge we faced was getting the images to align correct  when the user resized their viewport. At the beginning, the images were in different aspect ratios and didn’t adhere to a coherent standard. This problem was solved after some minor fixes.
